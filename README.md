# Iris-Flower-Data-Analysis

A comprehensive analysis and classification of the open-source Iris Flower Dataset. <br>

Machine learning algorithms like <b>KNN and SVM</b> are used for classification and their <b>hyperparameters</b> are tuned for optimal performance. <br>

This project contains an <b>elaborate discussion</b> of the most fundamental aspects of various machine learning techniques, all presented in the form of markdown files in the main notebook.
